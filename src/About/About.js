                    <h4 className='font-light pt-8'>MOTIVATION</h4>
                    <p>I'm a creative and dilligent software developer with a background in Neuroscience. I'm passionate about finding out how things work, and finding how they can work differently. My projects revolve around empowering others, which so far Iâ€™ve accomplished through education with data visualization.</p>
                    <h4 className='font-light pt-4'>TECH</h4>
                    <p>As far as technologies go, I'm well-versed in JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS in the front end, and Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, and Redis in the back-end, and the rest of the comprehensive list is in the 'Skills' section. The new technologies coming out daily are very promising, and my favorite part of starting a new project is finding which new tools have come out since the last project, and how I can utilize them for the next one.</p>
                    <h4 className='font-light pt-4'>WORK</h4>
                    <p>Working with others is how we make big things happen (teamwork makes the dream work, right?) and I treasure the opportunity to help people realize a vision that may be just out of reach. If you're looking for a developer to grow your business into something more, I'm always happy to talk and see what can happen. Contact me with the form below!</p>
